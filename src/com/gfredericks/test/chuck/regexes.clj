;;
;; This code is a bit circumlocutious for what it currently does,
;; because it was written with the following goals:
;;
;; - Be able to parse an arbitrary regular expression and identify
;;   which features are being used
;;   - If we can't do this we run the risk of e.g. treating special
;;     things as literals
;; - Report a parse error for any input string that cannot be successfully
;;   passed to re-pattern
;;   - This isn't strictly necessary for the API since users only pass in
;;     preexisting regexes, but it makes it easy to write a test.check
;;     test of the parser that takes an arbitrary string and expects
;;     re-pattern and our parser to accept/crash in unison
;; - Throw an exception if the regex uses a feature that we don't support,
;;   or uses ill-defined syntax that the JVM doesn't handle well
;;
;; So e.g. one of the results of these requirements is a lot of effort
;; in the grammar to correctly parse regex features that we don't
;; actually support (but are now in a good position to support in the
;; future if someone wants to put the effort in).
